# JDBC MySQL Project
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the JDBC MySQL Project, a Java project for educational purposes. This project showcases the use of the JDBC API to interact with a MySQL database. It focuses on managing departments and employees using the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern.

## Technologies and Concepts Learned
Throughout the course of working on this project, I had the opportunity to explore and learn the following technologies and concepts:

* **Java Programming**: I enhanced my Java programming skills by developing a robust application.
* **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: I gained hands-on experience with JDBC, a Java-based data access technology, and learned how to connect and interact with a MySQL database.
* **MySQL Database**: I learned about setting up a MySQL database, creating tables, and grasping the fundamentals of database management.
* **Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern**: I learned to implement the DAO pattern to separate data access logic from the rest of the application, promoting code organization and maintainability.
* **SQL Queries**: I wrote SQL queries to perform various database operations, such as insertion, updating, deletion, and data retrieval.
* **Git and GitHub**: I used Git for version control and project management on GitHub, including repository creation, pushing changes, and collaborating with others.

## Features
This project offers the following features:

1. Departments: Allows you to create, update, delete, and list departments.
2. Seller: Enables you to create, update, delete, and list sellers. Each seller is associated with a department.

Enjoy the educational project!
